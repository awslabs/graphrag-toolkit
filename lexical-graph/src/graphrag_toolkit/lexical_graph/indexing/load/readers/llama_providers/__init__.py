LlamaIndex-based document extraction providers.

This package contains extraction providers that wrap LlamaIndex document readers
to provide a consistent interface for extracting documents from various sources.

# Lazy loading - providers are imported and registered on-demand
# Import specific providers directly when needed:
# from .web_reader_provider import WebReaderProvider
# from .pdf_reader_provider import PDFReaderProvider
# etc.
