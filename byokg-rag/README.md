# BYOKG-RAG: Bring Your Own Knowledge Graph for Retrieval Augmented Generation 

![BYOKG-RAG Architecture](../images/byokg_rag.png)

BYOKG-RAG is a novel approach to Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) that combines the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured knowledge graphs. The system allows users to bring their own knowledge graph and perform complex question answering over it.

## Key Features üîë

- **Multi-strategy Retrieval**: Combines multiple retrieval strategies through iterative processing:
  - **Agentic triplet retrieval** for LLM-guided dynamic graph exploration
  - **Scoring-based triplet retrieval** for semantic-based triplet retrieval
  - **Path-based retrieval** for multi-hop reasoning through entity paths
  - **Query-based retrieval** for direct Cypher graph queries
- **Iterative Processing**: Uses iterative approach combining multi-strategy and Cypher-based retrieval
- **LLM-powered Reasoning**: Leverages state-of-the-art LLMs for question understanding and answer generation

## System Components ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **ByoKGQueryEngine** ([src/graphrag_toolkit/byokg_rag/byokg_query_engine.py](src/graphrag_toolkit/byokg_rag/byokg_query_engine.py))
   - Core orchestrating component with dual-mode processing
   - Implements iterative retrieval with configurable iterations
   - Combines multi-strategy and Cypher-based approaches

2. **KG Linkers** ([src/graphrag_toolkit/byokg_rag/graph_connectors](src/graphrag_toolkit/byokg_rag/graph_connectors))
   - **KGLinker**: Base class for LLM-guided graph operations
   - **CypherKGLinker**: Specialized for Cypher query generation and execution
   - Links natural language queries to graph entities and relationships

3. **Graph Retrievers** ([src/graphrag_toolkit/byokg_rag/graph_retrievers](src/graphrag_toolkit/byokg_rag/graph_retrievers))
   - **AgenticRetriever**: LLM-guided iterative exploration with entity linking
   - **PathRetriever**: Multi-hop reasoning through entity relationship paths
   - **GraphQueryRetriever**: Direct Cypher query execution and result processing
   - **Rerankers**: BGE-based semantic reranking for improving retrieval relevance

4. **Graph Store** ([src/graphrag_toolkit/byokg_rag/graphstore](src/graphrag_toolkit/byokg_rag/graphstore))
   - Manages knowledge graph data structure and connectivity
   - Provides interfaces for graph traversal and querying
   - Supports multiple graph database backends

## Performance üìà

Our results show that BYOKG-RAG outperforms existing approaches across multiple knowledge graph benchmarks:

| KGQA Hit (%) | Wiki-KG | Temp-KG | Med-KG |
|--------------|---------|---------|--------|
| Agent        | 77.8    | 57.3    | 59.2   |
| BYOKG-RAG    | 80.1    | 65.5    | 65.0   |
