### Lexical Graph

The [lexical-graph](./lexical-graph/) provides a framework for automating the construction of a [hierarchical lexical graph](./docs/lexical-graph/graph-model.md) from unstructured data, and composing question-answering strategies that query this graph when answering user questions.
